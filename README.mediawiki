= Symbol Munger = 

A library to make it easy to change the capitalization and spacing of
a "sentance".  This is mostly used for converting between space &
capitization rules of various systems.

This library is most useful where one needs to convert names between 
various systems (eg lisp to english, lisp to javascript style camel-case,
lisp to python style underscores, database column names to lisp-symbols etc)
